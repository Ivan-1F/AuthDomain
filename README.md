Auth the domain while a player is connecting to the server or pinging the server. Inspired by [Forgot-Dream/Authdomain](https://github.com/Forgot-Dream/Authdomain)

A config file will generate while the first time the plugin is loaded, it is located at `plugins/AuthDomain/auth-domain.yml`, you just have to fill in the domain and the kick message

You don't need to restart the server after modifying the config file
